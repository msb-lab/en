There are currently no funded positions available in the lab.

However, we are always interested in hearing from motivated, curious, and self-driven researchers. We welcome inquiries from prospective **PhD students, postdoctoral researchers, and undergraduate students** who are excited about our work and would like to explore possible opportunities.

The MSBlab strives to foster a **flexible, collaborative, and supportive environment** where every member can thrive. We prioritize the **well-being and professional growth** of all lab members and place strong emphasis on mentorship. We actively support each person in defining and achieving their goals --- scientific and otherwise --- and we dedicate time to discussing **career development, soft skills, and future opportunities** both within and beyond academia.

If you are interested in joining the lab in the future, or if you would like to discuss potential support through **fellowships or external funding programs**, please [reach out to Juan](mailto:juan.diaz@ipla.csic.es){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.
