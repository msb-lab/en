    "text": "Predicting the paths of evolution\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich specific sequence of mutations will turn a harmless microbe into a pathogen, a parasite into a drug-resistant strain, or a healthy cell into a cancer cell? Finding answers to these questions could help us stay ahead of antibiotic resistance, viral outbreaks, and cancer progression.\nOur lab studies how mathematical models can be used to forecast the pace and direction of evolution. We simulate evolution computationally and we also we evolve bacteria in the lab — watching evolution unfold in real time.\n Diaz-Colunga et al., Nature Communications (2023)\n Diaz-Colunga et al., Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B (2023)\n Diaz-Colunga et al., PLOS Computational Biology (2021)\n\n\n\n\nThe ecology & evolution of microbial communities\n\n\n\n\n\n(Micro)organisms do not live in isolation: the oceans, the soils, and even our own guts harbor an immense diversity of microbial life. These microbial communities provide important services for us and the whole biosphere, from decomposing organic matter to supporting our immune system. How do these communities change in the face of evolution, environmental perturbations, or the influx of new species?\nIn the lab, we build mathematical models of microbial interactions which help us address these questions. We simulate the dynamics of microbial communities in silico, and we also examine these dynamics in real communities, which we assemble and manipulate in controlled laboratory conditions.\n Diaz-Colunga et al., Cell (2024)\n Diaz-Colunga et al., PNAS (2022)\n\n\n\n\nEcological engineering & synthetic ecology\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to their key roles in natural ecosystems, microbial communities are also promising platforms for bioengineering: for instance, they can break down plastics and industrial waste or sustainably synthesize biofuels. Unlocking the full biotechnological potential of microbial communities requires that we are able to engineer them and optimize the processes they are responsible for.\nIn the MSBlab, we develop methods to guide the design of microbial communities. We apply these methods for a variety of biotechnologically-relevant purposes, from food fermentation to efficient biosynthesis of target chemical compounds.\n Diaz-Colunga et al., eLife (2024)\n Skwara et al., Nature Ecology & Evolution (2023)\n San Román et al., Frontiers in Synthetic Biology (2025)"

We welcome inquiries from prospective PhD students, postdoctoral researchers, and undergraduate students who are excited about our work and would like to explore possible opportunities.\nThe MSBlab strives to foster a flexible, collaborative, and supportive environment where every member can thrive. We prioritize the well-being and professional growth of all lab members and place strong emphasis on mentorship. We actively support each person in defining and achieving their goals — scientific and otherwise — and we dedicate time to discussing career development, soft skills, and future opportunities both within and beyond academia.\nIf you are interested in joining the lab in the future, or if you would like to discuss potential support through fellowships or external funding programs, please reach out to Juan."
